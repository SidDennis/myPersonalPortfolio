# myPersonalPortfolio
This is me, or rather a display of my progress since 17/12/2025 to the present. I hope to be able to document my progress and my evolution as a programmer here. 

# Something to get out of the way
For clarity, I've mostly been doing backend programming for the last few years. Recently however, I realised that I developed a habit of creating routes without considering what the frontend needs/requires. The assumptions I made when creating a backend would eventually backfire due to a few reasons including but not limited to useless routes, routes that took/returned objects with extra information that obfuscated everything and etc.

Therefore, for the next few projects, inlcuding this, I'm going to try building from a frontend developers perspective from figuring out what it needs to display to whether It needs a backend route at all.

## Use cases
A few things I'd like to display:
* My Work Experience
* Hackathons
* Websites/projects
* mini projects
* reflections/blog
* display people who've worked with me

## techstack
Frontend: React
backend: TBD
